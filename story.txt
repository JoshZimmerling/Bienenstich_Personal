It was on a bleak rainy day, sitting in the Berlin Airport, that I saw something I wouldn't soon forget.
I saw a squirrel racing across the tarmac with an entire Apfelkuchen in its mouth.
That pastry was from my auntie's baeckerei that only sells apple-based desserts.
My dog just ate my lederhose.
I can't believe he just did that; I just bought these at the Schloss Eltz!
I guess I should go chill out under this Klimaanlage vent.
While I'm at it, I'll make myself at mehlhase.
And since I've calmed down I can go to work at the Brot Store.
...and now I've lost my train of thought. 
Don't judge me too harshly, dear reader; it is clear that my mind was carried off in that squirrel's mouth along with the Apfelkuchen--and now image melds into unrelated image: more evidence of the disordered firings of my busted syntax!
My publisher says my short stories would hardly be wettbewerbsf√§hig in this literary market--what did he mean by those strange, lilting syllables?! I really should have studied a bit of German before I arrived.
