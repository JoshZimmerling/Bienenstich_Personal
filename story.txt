It was on a bleak rainy day, sitting in the Berlin Airport, that I saw something I wouldn't soon forget.
I saw a squirrel racing across the tarmac with an entire Apfelkuchen in its mouth.
That pastry was from my auntie's baeckerei that only sells apple-based desserts.
My dog just ate my lederhose.
I can't belive he just did that; I just bought these at the Schloss Eltz!
I guess I should go chill out under this Klimaanlage vent.
While I'm at it, I'll make myself at mehlhase.
